###Medical Insurance Cost Prediction
This repository contains a machine learning model for predicting medical insurance costs based on demographic and health-related features. The model is built using Python and popular libraries like Scikit-learn and Pandas.


###Introduction
Medical insurance costs can vary greatly depending on various factors such as age, gender, BMI (Body Mass Index), and other medical and personal details. The goal of this project is to build a predictive model that can accurately forecast insurance costs using these factors.

###Features
The dataset used includes the following features:

Age: Age of the insured person
Sex: Gender of the insured person (Male/Female)
BMI: Body mass index of the insured person
Children: Number of children/dependents covered by the insurance
Smoker: Whether the insured person smokes (Yes/No)
Region: The region where the insured person lives
Charges: The insurance charges (target variable)

###Installation
To run this project locally, ensure you have Python 3.x installed. You can install the required dependencies using the following steps:

###Clone the repository:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/harshith200481/Medical-Insurance.git
cd Medical-Insurance

###Model
The model used in this project is a linear regression model. It was selected after comparing performance with other regression models such as decision trees and random forests.

###Model Pipeline:
Data preprocessing (handling missing values, encoding categorical features)
Feature scaling
Model training (Linear Regression)




This README.md provides an overview of the project, guides users through installation and usage, and explains how the model works and its results. You can modify it based on your project's specific details.
